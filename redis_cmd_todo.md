## Priority Implementation Order

1. **High Priority** (Core Redis functionality):
   - Connection Management
   - Server Management  
   - Transactions
   - Missing Generic commands

2. **Medium Priority** (Advanced data types):
   - Stream Operations
   - Bitmap Operations
   - HyperLogLog Operations

3. **Low Priority** (Specialized features):
   - Geospatial Operations
   - Scripting and Functions
   - Cluster Management

## Implementation Notes

- All command files should follow the existing pattern in `libspine/engine/commands/`
- Storage operations should be implemented in `libspine/engine/storage/`
- Each command category should have corresponding unit tests
- Commands should be registered in `RegisterAllCommands()` function
- Use stream-based argument parsing for commands with variable arguments
- Pre-parse arguments for commands with fixed, small argument counts
